## Learning Outcomes
Through this practice session, I:

- Understood how Window Functions work in SQL
- Learned ranking and numbering techniques using SQL
- Practiced analytical reporting queries
- Learned how to calculate running totals and moving averages
- Improved understanding of partitioned calculations using PARTITION BY
- Learned how to analyze sequential data using LAG() and LEAD()
- Understood the concept of Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Practiced Recursive CTEs for hierarchical data analysis
- Improved SQL problem-solving and analytical thinking skills
- Gained practical experience with advanced SQL reporting queries

---

## Sample Queries Practiced

### Window Function Queries
- Assign row numbers to employees based on salary
- Rank employees department-wise
- Calculate dense rankings
- Divide employees into salary quartiles

### Analytical Queries
- Running total of order amounts
- Moving average of last 3 orders
- Department payroll calculations
- Salary percentage contribution analysis

### LAG() and LEAD() Queries
- Find previous order amount
- Find next order amount
- Compare current and previous sales

### CTE Queries
- Total sales per employee
- Customer spending analysis
- Ranking customers based on spending

### Recursive Queries
- Generate numbers using Recursive CTE
- Display employee-manager hierarchy

### Business Reporting Queries
- Find top-performing employees
- Generate monthly sales trend reports
- Calculate percentage sales growth

## Challenges Faced
Initially, understanding Window Functions and how PARTITION BY works was slightly challenging. Concepts like running totals, moving averages, recursive queries, and ranking calculations required careful practice and analysis. Recursive CTEs and analytical reporting queries were also more complex compared to basic SQL queries. After executing multiple examples and analyzing outputs step-by-step, the concepts became much easier to understand and apply.

## Conclusion
Successfully completed Week 1 - Day 4 advanced SQL practice tasks and developed a strong understanding of analytical SQL concepts including Window Functions, CTEs, Recursive Queries, Ranking Functions, and Trend Analysis. This session significantly improved SQL querying skills and built a strong foundation for advanced database management, data analytics, business intelligence, and data engineering workflows.
