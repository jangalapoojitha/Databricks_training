# PySpark Phase 4A – Bucketing & Customer Segmentation

## Overview

This project demonstrates multiple customer segmentation techniques using **PySpark**. It transforms continuous customer spending values into meaningful business categories such as **Gold**, **Silver**, and **Bronze** customers using different bucketing and ranking approaches. The project compares traditional business rule-based segmentation with machine learning-based bucketing techniques available in Apache Spark.

---

# Objectives

- Calculate total customer spending from sales transactions
- Perform customer segmentation using multiple approaches
- Compare rule-based and data-driven bucketing techniques
- Understand business-oriented and analytical customer segmentation
- Implement equivalent solutions using Spark SQL and the PySpark DataFrame API

---

# Technologies Used

- Python
- PySpark
- Apache Spark
- Spark SQL
- Spark MLlib
- Google Colab
- Jupyter Notebook

---

# Dataset

## sales.csv

Contains customer transaction records.

Columns include:

- sale_id
- customer_id
- product_id
- sale_date
- quantity
- total_amount

The dataset is used to calculate the total spending for each customer before applying different segmentation techniques.

---

# Project Workflow

## Step 1 – Data Ingestion

Load the sales dataset into a Spark DataFrame.

Tasks include:

- Read the CSV file
- Infer the schema
- Inspect the data structure

---

## Step 2 – Data Cleaning

Prepare the dataset for analysis.

Tasks include:

- Remove missing values
- Remove duplicate records
- Validate transaction amounts
- Verify data types

---

## Step 3 – Customer Spending Calculation

Aggregate the sales data to calculate the total spending for each customer.

Example output:

| customer_id | total_spend |
|-------------|-------------|

---

## Step 4 – Customer Segmentation

Apply multiple bucketing techniques to categorize customers based on their spending behavior.

---

# Bucketing Methods

## 1. Business Rule-Based Segmentation

Categorize customers using conditional logic.

### Business Rules

- **Gold** → Total Spend > 10000
- **Silver** → Total Spend between 5000 and 10000
- **Bronze** → Total Spend < 5000

This approach is implemented using PySpark's `when()` function.

---

## 2. SQL CASE Statement

Perform customer segmentation using Spark SQL.

Example logic:

- CASE WHEN Total Spend > 10000 THEN 'Gold'
- CASE WHEN Total Spend BETWEEN 5000 AND 10000 THEN 'Silver'
- ELSE 'Bronze'

---

## 3. Spark MLlib Bucketizer

Use **Bucketizer** to divide continuous spending values into predefined numerical ranges.

Features:

- Automatic bucket assignment
- Scalable MLlib transformation
- Suitable for machine learning preprocessing

---

## 4. Quantile-Based Segmentation

Create customer groups based on the distribution of spending values.

Example:

- Top 25%
- Middle 50%
- Bottom 25%

This method adapts to the data distribution instead of using fixed business thresholds.

---

## 5. Window-Based Customer Ranking

Rank customers using Spark Window Functions.

Functions used include:

- percent_rank()
- dense_rank()
- rank()

This enables percentile-based customer analysis.

---

# Tasks Completed

- Calculate customer spending
- Gold, Silver, and Bronze customer segmentation
- Segment-wise customer count
- Quantile-based customer grouping
- MLlib Bucketizer implementation
- Window-based customer ranking
- Spark SQL implementation
- Equivalent PySpark DataFrame implementation

---

# SQL and PySpark Implementation

Each segmentation technique is implemented using two approaches:

## Spark SQL

- CASE WHEN
- GROUP BY
- ORDER BY
- Aggregate Functions

## PySpark DataFrame API

- groupBy()
- agg()
- withColumn()
- when()
- Bucketizer
- Window Functions
- percent_rank()
- dense_rank()
- rank()

This demonstrates the equivalence between SQL queries and PySpark DataFrame transformations.
