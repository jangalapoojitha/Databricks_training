# SQL to PySpark Phase 2

## Overview

This project bridges the gap between basic SQL queries and real-world PySpark data engineering workflows. It introduces essential Spark DataFrame operations by solving practical business problems using sample customer and order datasets. Each exercise is implemented using both **Spark SQL** and the **PySpark DataFrame API**, helping learners understand how traditional SQL operations translate into distributed data processing with Apache Spark.

---

# Objectives

- Bridge the transition from SQL to PySpark
- Learn the fundamentals of PySpark DataFrame operations
- Perform data cleaning before analysis
- Practice joins and aggregations using real-world datasets
- Compare SQL queries with equivalent PySpark DataFrame transformations
- Build confidence for developing advanced Spark ETL pipelines

---

# Technologies Used

- Python
- PySpark
- Apache Spark
- Spark SQL
- Google Colab
- Jupyter Notebook

---

# Datasets

## customers.csv

Contains customer information.

Columns include:

- customer_id
- first_name
- last_name
- email
- city
- state

The dataset includes a few missing customer IDs to practice data cleaning techniques.

---

## orders.csv

Contains customer order transactions.

Columns include:

- order_id
- customer_id
- order_date
- order_amount

Some records contain missing values to simulate real-world data scenarios.

---

# Project Workflow

## Step 1 – Data Ingestion

Load the customer and order datasets into Spark DataFrames.

Tasks include:

- Reading CSV files
- Inferring the schema
- Inspecting the data
- Validating record counts

---

## Step 2 – Data Cleaning

Prepare the datasets for analysis.

Operations include:

- Removing rows with missing customer IDs
- Dropping invalid records
- Removing duplicate rows
- Validating schema consistency

---

## Step 3 – SQL to PySpark Translation

Implement each business problem using both:

### Spark SQL

and

### PySpark DataFrame API

This demonstrates how SQL queries can be translated into equivalent PySpark DataFrame transformations.

# Guided Exercises

## 1. Total Order Amount per Customer

Calculate the total amount spent by each customer.

### Output

| customer_id | total_spend |
|-------------|-------------|

---

## 2. Top 3 Customers by Total Spend

Identify the top three customers based on their total spending.

### Output

| customer_name | total_spend |
|---------------|-------------|

---

## 3. Customers with No Orders

Find customers who have not placed any orders using joins.

### Output

| customer_id | customer_name |
|-------------|---------------|

---

## 4. City-wise Revenue

Calculate the total revenue generated from each city.

### Output

| city | total_revenue |
|------|---------------|

---

## 5. Average Order Amount per Customer

Calculate the average order amount for each customer.

### Output

| customer_id | average_order |
|-------------|---------------|

---

## 6. Customers with More Than One Order

Identify repeat customers using grouping and filtering operations.

### Output

| customer_id | order_count |
|-------------|-------------|

---

## 7. Sort Customers by Total Spending

Display customers in descending order based on their total spending.

### Output

| customer_name | total_spend |
|---------------|-------------|

# Project Goal

This project serves as a practical bridge between SQL and PySpark by demonstrating how common SQL operations—such as filtering, grouping, joins, sorting, and aggregations—can be implemented using the PySpark DataFrame API. It provides a strong foundation for learners preparing for advanced Spark-based data engineering and analytics projects.
