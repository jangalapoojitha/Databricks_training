# DATE & TIMESTAMP FUNCTIONS IN MYSQL

## Objective

The objective of this session was to learn and practice Date and Timestamp functions in MySQL using real-world business scenarios. The focus was on handling dates, extracting date parts, performing date arithmetic, formatting timestamps, calculating date differences, and implementing time-based filtering queries for reporting and analytics.

## Tasks Completed

- Created and populated the `orders` table with sample data
- Practiced MySQL Date and Timestamp functions
- Extracted year, month, and day from dates
- Implemented weekend and weekday detection queries
- Performed date arithmetic using `DATE_ADD()` and `DATE_SUB()`
- Calculated delivery durations using `DATEDIFF()` and `TIMESTAMPDIFF()`
- Formatted dates and timestamps using `DATE_FORMAT()`
- Converted string values into date format using `STR_TO_DATE()`
- Implemented financial year calculation logic using `CASE`
- Built real-time filtering queries for recent and current orders
- Verified query outputs for correctness
- Organized SQL scripts and documentation in GitHub repository structure
